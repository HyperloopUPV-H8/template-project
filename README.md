# template-freeRTOS-project
Fork of the template project to support creating projects with freeRTOS with support for VScode

**This project allows to use VS code in Linux ONLY for Windows use skip to the bottom**


**Linux**


**Set Up:**

move the STLIB from your current location to /opt/ST-LIB:

To do so:

  go into the parent directory that contains the STLIB and move it to `/opt`
  
`sudo mv -r ST-LIB /opt`

We want to give permissions so that we can work without issues, also the build script moves some things around
better to give the user permissions

`sudo chmod a+rwx /opt/STLIB`

clone this repo:
`git clone git@github.com:HyperloopUPV-H8/template-freeRTOS-project.git`
and run `git submodule init` to start the freeRTOSlib submodule

open VS code 
and go into `Open workspace from file`
![open workspace](https://github.com/HyperloopUPV-H8/template-freeRTOS-project/assets/58850783/67d52a4c-d243-46ac-b272-4c93095e422e)

and select template-project.code-workspace
After selecting it a view similar to this one will open:

Further steps:

to build the program press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `B`, and select the configuration you want to build

If at the bottom you choose terminal view, you will see the output

After the build has finished go into the menu on the left and select the Run and Debug view,

choose the configuration you want to run [Debug, Release]

After launching, the following view shows:

That's it you can start using VS Code in Linux for firmware development.



**Windows User**

Step 1:
 Switch to Linux
 
Step 2:
  Read the guide above for Linux setup
  
In case you are still using Windows:

clone this repo:
`git clone git@github.com:HyperloopUPV-H8/template-freeRTOS-project.git`
and run `git submodule init` to start the freeRTOSlib submodule
